<h1 align="center">IconeJz Website</h1>

On this [website][website] you will find two sections; ["Use examples"][use-examples] and ["Icons"][icons].

In ["Use examples"][use-examples] you will have at your disposal a series of examples that will show you how you can use the Javascript api.

And in the ["Icons"][icons] section, you'll find a visualization of every available icon that IconeJz owns.

Thank you for reading! I hope you like the project!

Have a good day! ✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧
